# oakley_eurorack_black_panels
This repository includes a collection of .fpd front panel files for Oakley Sound Systems's eurorack synthesizer modules. These panels have been adapted from their original natural aluminum color to a black color with white engraved text.

Please take a look at what Tony Allgood has available on his website: [Oakley Sound Systems](http://www.oakleysound.com/).
